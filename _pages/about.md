I am an Assistant Professor at The Ohio State University. I earned my Ph.D. in Mathematics with a concentration in Actuarial Science and Risk Analytics from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1227/9265.htm">Dr. Runhuan Feng</a> and <a href = "https://sites.google.com/view/wingfungalfredchong/home">Dr. Wing Fung (Alfred) Chong</a>. I am also an Associate of the Society of Actuaries (SOA).

During the final year of my Ph.D. studies (Fall 2022 – Summer 2023), I served as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Actuarial Science at Drake University in Iowa.

Before starting my doctoral program, I worked as a research assistant at the Critical Infrastructure Resilience Institute, gaining three years of experience in cyber risk and cyber insurance. Throughout my Ph.D., I led and contributed to multiple research projects funded by the Society of Actuaries, Fundación MAPFRE, and Cisco.

My research focuses on cyber risk and its implications for actuarial science, risk management, and related fields. I have published peer-reviewed articles in journals such as The Geneva Papers on Risk and Insurance: Issues and Practice, IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing, and the Connecticut Insurance Law Journal. Beyond cyber risk, I am actively exploring emerging topics in actuarial science, including pandemic risk and privacy risk.
