            In today’s insurance market, numerous cyber insurance products provide bundled coverage for losses resulting from different cyber events, including data breaches and ransomware attacks. Every category of incident has its own specific coverage limit and deductible. Although this gives prospective cyber insurance buyers more flexibility in customizing the coverage and better manages the risk exposures of sellers, it complicates the decision-making process in determining the optimal amount of risks to retain and transfer for both parties. This article aims to build an economic foundation for these incident-specific cyber insurance products with a focus on how incident-specific indemnities should be designed for achieving Pareto optimality for both the insurance seller and the buyer. Real data on cyber incidents are used to illustrate the feasibility of this approach. Several implementation improvement methods for practicality are also discussed.},

            Our society's efforts to fight pandemics rely heavily on our ability to understand, model and predict the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. Compartmental models are among the most commonly used mathematical tools to explain reported infections and deaths. This chapter offers a brief overview of basic compartmental models as well as several actuarial applications, ranging from product design and reserving of epidemic insurance, to the projection of healthcare demand and the allocation of scarce resources. The intent is to bridge classical epidemiological models with actuarial and financial applications that provide healthcare coverage and utilise limited healthcare resources during pandemics.},
